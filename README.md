# Unreal Engine Interactive 3D Visualizer
Here are some resources so you can get started with controlling events and effects inside of Unreal Engine 5.4 and above via an audio/MIDI to OSC workflow. This is achieved through some MaxForLive devices following an audio/MIDI to OSC protocol, as used in the Ableton Live Suite.

Features include a MIDI to OSC MaxForLive device that outputs data pretraining to Pitch Value, Velocity, Number of Notes being triggered, Time Between Notes, Duration, Random Number Generator, Scalable Counter, current Bar Counter, current Beat counter, and current tempo.
There's also a flexible sample accurate MaxForLive Envelope Follower that allows you to generate float data based on the amplitude of incoming audio data.

A playlist of tutorials and walkthroughs regarding these MaxForLive devices and Unreal Engine blueprints can be found here:

If you happen to have any ideas on how to improve the project, please feel free to contribute!


The Unreal Engine blueprints and MaxForLive devices are built off of the work as found on the "Sem and Tris AV Club" as well as their own respective YouTube channels. So be sure to check out their channels for even further information on the basics regarding the blueprints. Thanks for allowing me to modify the project, as well as for allowing me to make the modified version open source.
